To contribute to your tutor's public GitHub repository, here's the step-by-step procedure:
## Basic Workflow Overview
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork to your local machine
3. Create a branch for your changes

5. Push your branch to your fork
6. Create a pull request
## Detailed Steps
### 1. Fork the Repository
